        <p>Shivaji Maharaj is one of the great national heroes of India. He created an independent and sovereign state
          in Maharashtra which was based on justice, welfare of the people and tolerance to all faiths. The aims,
          objectives and Rajnitee of the Maratha Swaraj under Chhatrapati Shivaji provided a new direction to
          contemporary politics of India. In course of time, his movement assumed, the form of an all-India struggle; a
          struggle which was to change the political map of India.

          Shivaji Maharaj was born at the Shivneri fort near Junnar in Pune district on 19th February 1630. Shivaji’s
          mother, Jijabai was the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed.
          His father Shahajiraje Bhosale was a prominent sardar in the Deccan. At the time of Shivaji Maharaj’s birth,
          most of the territory in Maharashtra was under the
          possession of the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur. In the coastal belt of Konkan there
          were two sea powers, the Portuguese and the Siddi.
          The British and the Dutch who were engaged in expanding their trade also had their factories on the coast. The
          Mughals, since the period of Emperor Akbar 1 wanted to
          expand their power in the South. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the Nizamshahi Kingdom. The
          Adilshah of Bijapur allied with the Mughals in this campaign.
          Shahahajiraje tried to save the Nizamshahi, but he could not withstand the combined might of the Mughals and
          the Adilshahi.
          The Nizamshahi kingdom came to an end in A.D. 1636. Thereafter Shahajiraje became a sardar of the Adilshah of
          Bijapur and was posted in Karnataka.
          The region comprising Pune, Supe, Indapur and Chakan parganas located between the Bhima and Nira rivers which
          was vested in Shahajiraje as a jagir was continued by
          the Adilshah. Shahaijiraje was also assigned a jagir of Banglore. Veermata Jijabai and Shivajiraje, stayed for
          a few years with Shahajiraje at Banglore till
          Shivajiraje was twelve years old. Shahajiraje entrusted the administration of the Pune jagir to Shivajiraje
          and Veermata Jijabai. Shivajiraje grew up amidst the
          hills and valleys of Pune region under the guidance of his mother Jijabai.</p>
